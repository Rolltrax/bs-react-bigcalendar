# bs-react-bigcalendar

Bucklescript/Reason bindings for react-big-calendar.

## Info

ðŸš§ This is a WIP library. Not all features/props are currently implemented. If you need a missing feature, feel free to open an issue, or (better yet), make a pull request. ðŸš§

Bucklescript/Reason bindings for [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/intljusticemission/react-big-calendar).

## Dependencies

bs-react-bigcalendar uses the Moment.js localizer for react-big-calendar. While you can get away with only using Js Date objects, it is much easier to use the bs-moment library and instantiate a date object as a `Moment.t` and then convert using `Moment.toDate`.

## Examples
Example code can be found in the test directory
